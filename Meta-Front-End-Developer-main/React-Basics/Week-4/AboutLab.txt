About this graded assessment: Calculator app
The purpose of this graded assessment
The primary purpose of a graded assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course you have just completed. Most importantly, graded assessments help you establish which topics you have mastered and which require further focus before completing the course. Ultimately, the graded assessment is designed to help you make sure that you can apply what you have learned. This assessment's learning objective is to allow you to create a React application or App.

Prepare for this graded assessment
You will have already encountered exercises, knowledge checks, in-video questions and other assessments as you have progressed through the course. The 'styling a page' ungraded lab from Module 2 is the foundation for this assessment.

The graded assessment requires you to complete a calculator in React. You will be provided with code snippets, and your task is to use these, plus any of your code to complete the calculator that can perform the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It will also have a single input button, which will accept user input (any number) and a total starting with a zero.

Once a user types into the input field, they will then have to update the total by pressing any of the four math operation buttons:

addition 

subtraction 

multiplication 

division 

Here's a diagram of the completed calculator app:

Nothing in the graded assessment will be outside what you have covered already, so you should be well placed to succeed. 

Review the graded assessment
You will review your page to assess whether it meets the requirements outlined in the self-review quiz.

Good luck!
