Pseudo-elements
By now you know that pseudo-elements help you style a specific part of an element. For example, you can decide to apply styling to only the first word or line in a given element. First, let’s examine the syntax of a pseudo-element.

Syntax
selector::pseudo-element {

 property: value; 

}

It is important to note that pseudo-elements use two colon characters instead of one.

Now, let’s explore some examples of popular pseudo-elements.

::first-letter
You can use first-letter to change the color of just the first letter of each of the three points in the example text.

HTML code:

<!DOCTYPE html> 

<html> 

    <head> 

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="pseudo4.css"> 

    </head> 


CSS code:

li::first-letter { 

color:coral; 

font-size: 1.3em; 

font-weight: bold; 

line-height: 1; 


Output

The output when the pseudo-element first-letter are used to change the size and color of the first letter of list items.
Although the code only changed the first letter of each bullet point, it makes a big difference in terms of presentation. Now let’s change the font in a different way. 

::first-line
First-line will change the complete first line of each of the bullet points to light sea green. 

CSS code:

ul{
    list-style-type: none;
}

li::first-line {
    color: lightseagreen;
    text-decoration: underline;
    line-height: 1;
}

Output:

Display of underlined first line of each bulleted item item
Because it’s only the first line of each bullet point, it almost functions like dividers between the three different points instead of having to rely on bullets.  

Note that the contents of the line to which this pseudo-element is applied will change as you increase or decrease the size of your viewport. 

Output:

Output for the first underlined line in the increased size format of the text
::selection
Selection is another useful pseudo-element. For example, you may use it when you are taking notes on your device because it allows you to highlight specific text. The effect of it becomes obvious only after the user selects content. On web pages today, you will typically see inverted colors from white-black to black-white when selecting a portion of text.

CSS code:

ul{
    list-style-type: none;
}

li::selection {
    color:brown;
    background-color: antiquewhite;
    line-height: 1;
}

 Here is an example of a selection of text.

 Output:

Output for selection of text display
And another example of the same text but with a different section selected and highlighted.

Output:

Selection of different part of text display
  Different segments of the text are highlighted depending on the text that is selected at any given point.    

::marker  
Markers are typically used to add style elements to a list, for instance, to color bullet points. For example, you can enhance the user experience when you use a marker in the following way.    

CSS code:

li::marker {
    color: cornflowerblue;
    content: '<> ';
    font-size: 1.1em;
}

Output

Output for the demonstration of markers
  

Now the bullet points are cornflower blue and they have the shape specified in the code.

::before and ::after
One more pair of pseudo-elements are the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. They allow you to add content before and after an element on which they are allowed. In other words, new content can be added to a page without adding HTML code for it. You can also add styling options for this content. Let’s do an example where text is added both before and after some cooking guidelines to identify them as important tips. 

HTML code:

123456
<body>
    <p id="tips"> Don't rinse your pasta after it is drained. </p>
    <p> Slice the tomatoes. Take the extra efforts to seed them. </p>
    <p id="tips"> Peel and seed large tomatoes. </p>
</body>

CSS code:

#tips::before{
    background: darkkhaki;
    color:darkslategray;
    content: "Tip:";
    padding-left: 3px;
    padding-right: 5px;
    border-radius: 10%;
}

#tips::after{

Output:

Selection of texts preceding and following a statement
The “content” property is where the text for the guidelines goes. The word “tip” has been added before each guideline thanks to the rules added for tips::before. And, each of the three guidelines now has two exclamation marks after them thanks to the rules added for tips::after. Note how the second <p> element inside the HTML code remains unaffected. You don’t have to use after and before together like this, but sometimes it is useful to combine them.

The examples covered here illustrate that adding simple code for pseudo-elements can greatly enhance the appearance of websites. There are plenty of other pseudo-elements and some of them are more popular than others. You can follow your own style and explore the creative possibilities that pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements offer.
