Solution: Implementing scroller position with render props
Here is the completed solution code for the App.js file:  

import "./App.css";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const MousePosition = ({ render }) => {
  const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleMousePositionChange = (e) => {
      setMousePosition({
        x: e.clientX,
        y: e.clientY,
      });
    };

    window.addEventListener("mousemove", handleMousePositionChange);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("mousemove", handleMousePositionChange);
    };
  }, []);

  return render({ mousePosition });
};

const PanelMouseLogger = () => {
  return (
    <div className="BasicTracker">
      <p>Mouse position:</p>
      <MousePosition
        render={({ mousePosition }) => (
          <div className="Row">
            <span>x: {mousePosition.x}</span>
            <span>y: {mousePosition.y}</span>
          </div>
        )}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

const PointMouseLogger = () => {
  return (
    <MousePosition
      render={({ mousePosition }) => (
        <p>
          ({mousePosition.x}, {mousePosition.y})
        </p>
      )}
    />
  );
};

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="Header">Little Lemon Restaurant üçï</header>
      <PanelMouseLogger />
      <PointMouseLogger />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

1. Implement the body of handleMousePositionChange

The mousemove handler function receives an event as parameter that contains the mouse coordinates as clientX and clientY properties. Therefore you can provide a position update by calling the state setter setMousePosition with the new values.

const handleMousePositionChange = (e) => {
 setMousePosition({
   x: e.clientX,
   y: e.clientY,
 });
};


2. Implement the return statement of the component

 The MousePosition component receives a render prop, which is the special prop name designed by convention to specify a function that returns some JSX. Since the MousePosition component does not take care of any visualization logic, but rather encapsulates cross-cutting concerns, it should return the result of calling the render function with the mousePosition as an argument. In other words, it‚Äôs up to the components that consume MousePosition to specify what sort of UI they want to display when they receive a new value of the mouse position on the screen. 

    return render({ mousePosition })
Step 2

The PanelMouseLogger component should not receive any props. Hence, the early return from the previous implementation if no props were provided is no longer needed.

Instead, the mousePosition is now injected as the first argument of the render function prop that MousePosition uses. It‚Äôs in this render function body where the previous JSX should be extracted and returned. 

const PanelMouseLogger = () => {
 return (
   <div className="BasicTracker">
     <p>Mouse position:</p>
     <MousePosition
       render={({ mousePosition }) => (
         <div className="Row">
           <span>x: {mousePosition.x}</span>
           <span>y: {mousePosition.y}</span>
         </div>
       )}
     />
   </div>
 );
};


Step 3

Similarly, as in step 2, the component should not receive any props and the early if statement should be removed. The particular UI for this component is provided as part of the render prop as well. 

const PointMouseLogger = () => {
 return (
   <MousePosition
     render={({ mousePosition }) => (
       <p>
         ({mousePosition.x}, {mousePosition.y})
       </p>
     )}
   />
 );
};


At this point, the implementation has been completed and you should see the following result when you run the app in the browser:
