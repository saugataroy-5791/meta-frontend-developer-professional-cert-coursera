Create a high-fidelity prototype based on a wireframe
Create high-fidelity user interface elements
Recognize the importance of design systems
Apply advanced UI techniques in Figma


Make it Beautiful
    The main elements are 
    line, 
    text, 
    color, 
    shape, 
    graphic elements such as icons and images, and

Design System 
    Typgraphy
    Color
    Layouts
    Grids
    Coding Standards
    Naming System etc

Atomic Design
    1. Atoms (Individual Elements i.e., html elements)
    2. Molecules (Combined Atoms)
    3. Organisms (Group Molecules)

UI Kit
    A UI kit is like a design system, but it is limited to the elements and features that populate a User Interface.
