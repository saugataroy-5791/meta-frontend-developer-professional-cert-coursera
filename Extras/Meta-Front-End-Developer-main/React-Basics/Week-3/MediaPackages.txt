In this reading, youâ€™ll learn how to install the reactjs-media npm package.

You can find this package on the npmjs.org website at the following URL: 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player

To install this package you'll need to use the following command in the terminal:

1
npm install react-player

Once you have this package installed, you can start using it in your project.

There are a few ways that you can import and use the installed package. For example, to get the entire package's functionality, use the following import:

import ReactPlayer from "react-player";
If you are, for example, only planning to use videos from a site like YouTube, to reduce bundle size, you can use the following import:

1
import ReactPlayer from "react-player/youtube";

import React from "react";
import ReactPlayer from "react-player/youtube";

  return (

      <MyVideo />
    </div>
  );
};
